## Project Descriptions

This project is meant to create an explainable and safe model to classify breast cancer tissue as malignant or bening.

This code consists of:
- Exploritory Data Analysis
- Nested Cross-Validation of multiple models over several seeds
- Creating a LIME and SHAP model based on the highest performing model
- Uncertainty analysis


## Running the Code
We recommend running the code in Google Colab, as it was written for this environment. Please download the dataset from this repo, as make sure to include it in your Google Drive.

## Contribution Statement
